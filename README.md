# SeleniumUITesting

## Preparation

- An IDE that supports Java code has to be installed 
- Chrome has to be installed

### Install a Chrome Webdriver 
First of all, you have to find out, which Google Chrome version you have installed to know which 
WebDriver version you need. You can find your installed Chrome version in the Chrome browser 
settings

You may then install the corresponding Chrome WebDriver. Find the latest Chrome WebDriver 
releases here (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads).

### Download Selenium Webdriver for Java 
You can download the Selenium Webdriver libraries [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
Make sure to select the language binding for Java if you want to use it in a Java project.

You then have to add the downloaded libraries into your Java project. Make sure to store the 
download somewhere you can find it again easily. Create a Java project in your wished IDE and add 
the external libraries to the project.

For further instructions on the preparation, design and implementation of this project see the PDF document ["Instructions.pdf"](https://github.com/StefanieNeumann00/SeleniumUITesting/blob/main/documentation/Instructions.pdf) in the documentation folder.
